 * \brief Source terms associated at the boundary faces and the neighboring
 *        cells with surface condensation.
 *
 * This function fills the condensation source terms for each variable at
 * the cell center associated to the boundary faces identifed in the mesh.
 * The fluid exchange coefficient is computed with a empirical law to be
 * imposed at the boundary face where the condensation phenomenon occurs.
 *
 * This user function is called which allows the setting of
 * \f$ \gamma_{\mbox{cond}} \f$ the condensation source term.
 *
 * This function fills the condensation source term array gamma_cond adding
 * to the following equations:
 *
 * - The equation for mass conservation:
 * \f[ D\frac{rho}{dt} + divs \left( \rho \vect{u}^n\right) = \Gamma _{cond}
 * \f]
 *
 * - The equation for a variable \f$\Phi \f$:
 * \f[ D\frac{\phi}{dt} = ... + \Gamma _{cond}*(\Phi _i - \Phi)
 * \f]
 *
 * discretized as below:
 *
 * \f[ \rho*\dfrac{\Phi^{n+1}-\Phi^{n}}/dt = ...
 *                            + \Gamma _{cond}*(\Phi _i - \Phi^{n+1})
 * \f]
 *
 * \remarks
 *  - \f$ \Phi _i \f$ is the value of \f$ \Phi \f$ associated to the
 *    injected condensation rate.
 *
 *    With 2 options are available:
 *       - the condensation rate is injected with the local value
 *         of variable \f$ \Phi = \Phi ^{n+1}\f$
 *         in this case the \f$ \Phi \f$ variable is not modified.
 *
 *       - the condensation rate is injected with a specific value
 *         for \f$ \Phi = \Phi _i \f$ the specified value given by the
 *         user.
 *
 * \section use Usage
 *
 * The three stages in the code where this User subroutine
 * is called (with \code iappel = 1, 2 and 3\endcode)
 *
 * \code iappel = 1 \endcode
 *  - Calculation of the number of cells where a mass source term is
 *    imposed: ncesmp
 *    Called once at the beginning of the calculation
 *
 * \code iappel = 2 \endcode
 *   - Identification of the cells where a mass source term is imposed:
 *     array icesmp(ncesmp)
 *     Called once at the beginning of the calculation
 *
 * \code iappel = 3 \endcode
 *   - Calculation of the values of the mass source term
 *     Called at each time step
 *
 * \section the specific variables to define with is user subroutine
 *
 *  - ifbpcd(ieltcd): identification of the faces where a condensation
 *                    source term is imposed.
 *
 *  - itypcd(ieltcd,ivar): type of treatment for variable ivar in the
 *                       ieltcd cell with condensation source term.
 *                     - itypcd = 0 -- * injection of ivar at local value
 *                     - itypcd = 1 -- * injection of ivar at user
 *                                      specified value.
 *
 *  - spcond(ielscd,ipr): value of the injection condensation rate
 *                       gamma_cond (kg/m3/s) in the ieltcd cell
 *                       with condensation source term.
 *
 *  - spcond(ieltcd,ivar): specified value for variable ivar associated
 *                        to the injected condensation in the ieltcd
 *                        cell with a condensation source term except
 *                        for ivar=ipr.
 *
 * \remarks
 *  - For each face where a condensation source terms is imposed ielscd
 *    in [1;nfbpcd]), ifbpcd(ielscd) is the global index number of the
 *    corresponding face (ifbpcd(ieltcd) in [1;ncel]).
 *  - if itypcd(ieltcd,ivar)=0, spcond(ielpcd,ivar) is not used.
 *  - if spcond(ieltcd,ipr)<0, mass is removed from the system,
 *     therefore Code_Saturna automatically considers f_i=f^(n+1),
 *     whatever the values of itypcd or smacel specified by the user
 *
 *   \par Examples of settings for boundary condensation mass source terms
 *        Examples are available
 *        \ref condens_h_boundary "here".
 *
 * \param[in]     nvar          total number of variables
 * \param[in]     nscal         total number of scalars
 * \param[in]     iappel        indicates which at which stage the routine is
