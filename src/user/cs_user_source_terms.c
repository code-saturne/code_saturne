 * \brief Additional user-defined source terms for variable equations
 *        (momentum, scalars, turbulence...).
 *
 *  This function is called at each time step, for each relevant field.
 *  It is therefore necessary to
 *  test the value of the field id or name to separate
 *  the treatments of the different variables.
 *
 *  The additional source term is decomposed into an explicit part (st_exp) and
 *  an implicit part (st_imp) that must be provided here.
 *  The resulting equation solved by the code for a scalar f is:
 *
 *    \f[ \rho*volume*\frac{df}{dt} + .... = st\_imp*f + st\_exp \f]
 *
 *  Note that st_exp and st_imp are defined after the Finite Volume integration
 *  over the cells, so they include the "volume" term. More precisely:
 *    - st_exp is expressed in kg.[var]/s, where [var] is the unit of the
 *      variable.
 *      Its dimension is the one of the variable (3 for vectors)
 *    - st_imp is expressed in kg/s.
 *      Its dimension is 1 for scalars, 3x3 for vectors.
 *
 *  The st_exp and st_imp arrays are already initialized to 0 (or a value
 *  defined through the GUI or defined by a model) before entering
 *  the function. It is generally not useful to reset them here.
 *
 *  For stability reasons, code_saturne will not add -st_imp directly to the
 *  diagonal of the matrix, but Max(-st_imp,0). This way, the st_imp term is
 *  treated implicitely only if it strengthens the diagonal of the matrix.
 *  However, when using the second-order in time scheme, this limitation cannot
 *  be done anymore and -st_imp is added directly. The user should therefore
 *  check for the negativity of st_imp.
 *
 *  When using the second-order in time scheme, one should supply:
 *    - st_exp at time n
 *    - st_imp at time n+1/2
 *
 *  \warning
 *  \parblock
 *
 *   If the variable is a temperature, the resulting equation solved is:
 *
 *   rho*Cp*volume*dT/dt + .... = st_imp*T + st_exp
 *
 *  \endparblock
 *
 *  Note that st_exp and st_imp are defined after the Finite Volume integration
 *  over the cells, so they include the "volume" term. More precisely:
 *    - st_exp is expressed in W
 *    - st_imp is expressed in W/K
 *
 *  \par Steep source terms
 *  \parblock
 *
 *  In case of a complex, non-linear source term, say F(f), for variable f, the
 *  easiest method is to implement the source term explicitly.
 *
 *    df/dt = .... + F(f(n))
 *    where f(n) is the value of f at time tn, the beginning of the time step.
 *
 *  This yields:
 *    st_exp = volume*F(f(n))
 *    st_imp = 0
 *
 *  However, if the source term is potentially steep, this fully explicit
 *  method will probably generate instabilities. It is therefore wiser to
 *  partially implicit the term by writing:
 *
 *    df/dt = .... + dF/df*f(n+1) - dF/df*f(n) + F(f(n))
 *
 *  This yields:
 *    st_exp = volume*( F(f(n)) - dF/df*f(n) )
 *    st_imp = volume*dF/df
 *
 *  \endparblock
 *
 * \param[in, out]  domain   pointer to a cs_domain_t structure
 * \param[in]       f_id     field id of the variable
 * \param[out]      st_exp   explicit source term
 * \param[out]      st_imp   implicit part of the source term
