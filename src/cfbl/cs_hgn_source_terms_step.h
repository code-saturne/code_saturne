 * \brief Compute the source terms for the two-phase flow model
 *
 * Update of these three fractions to account for the return to
 * equilibrium source terms. This update is deduced by solving the ODE
 * associated to the source term for each fraction.
 *
 * First we compute the equilibrium fractions and second the fractions are
 * relaxed towards those equilibrium values. Relaxation timescale \f$ \tau \f$
 * is to be provided by the user (equal to 1e-30 by default).
 *
 * Note that the energy, velocity and density remain constant throuh this
 * fractional step but the pressure and the temperature depend on the
 * fractions and thus evolve. They are updated at the end of the step
 * using the thermodynamic relation defined in \ref cs_hg_thermo.c.
