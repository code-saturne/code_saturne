  \section intro Introduction

  PLE is a libary designed to simplify coupling of distributed parallel
  computational codes. It is maintained as a part of Code_Saturne,
  EDF's general purpose Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software,
  but it may also be used with other tools, and is distributed under
  a broader licence (LGPL instead of GPL).

  PLE provides support for 2 categories of tasks: synchronizing
  parallel codes at predifined points, and enabling parallel mapping
  of points to meshes, and transfer of variables using this mapping.

  \subsection ple_coupling PLE Coupling API

  The ple_coupling_...() functions allow identifying applications and
  defining MPI communicators necessary to the ple_locator_...()
  functions, as well as providing each of a set of coupled codes
  with info on the other code's time steps, convergence status, and
  other synchronization data at predifined points (usually once per
  time step).

  \subsection ple_locator PLE Locator subset

  The ple_locator_...() functions allow mapping points to a mesh
  in parallel, given serial functions providing this functionnality
  for the associated data structures, then exchanging variables using
  this mapping.
