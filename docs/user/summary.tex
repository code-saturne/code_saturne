\CS is a system designed to solve the Navier-Stokes
equations in the cases of 2D, 2D axisymmetric or 3D flows. Its main module is
designed for the simulation of flows which may be steady or
unsteady, laminar or turbulent, incompressible or potentially dilatable,
isothermal or not. Scalars and turbulent fluctuations of scalars can be taken into
account. The code includes specific modules, referred to as ``specific physics'',
for the treatment of Lagrangian particle tracking, semi-transparent radiative transfer,
gas combustion, pulverised coal combustion,
electricity effects (Joule effect and electric arcs) and compressible flows.
\CS relies on a finite volume discretisation and allows the use of
various mesh types which may be hybrid (containing several kinds of
elements) and may have structural non-conformities (hanging nodes).

The present document is a practical user's guide for \CS version \verscs.
It is the result of the joint effort of
all the members in the development team.
It presents all the necessary elements to run a calculation
with \CS version \verscs. It then lists all the variables of the code
which may be useful for more advanced utilisation.
The user subroutines of all the modules within the code are then documented.
Eventually, for each key word and user-modifiable parameter in the code,
their definition, allowed values, default values and conditions for use are given.
These key words and parameters are grouped under headings
based on their function. An alphabetical index list is also given at the end of
the document for easier consultation.
