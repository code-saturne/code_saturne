\section{Keyword list}
%==================================
%==================================
\label{sec:prg_motscles}

The keywords are classified under relevant headings. For each keyword of \CS Kernel,
the following informations are given:

\noindent
\makebox[2.5cm][l]{Variable name}\makebox[1.3cm][l]{Type}%
\makebox[5cm][l]{Allowed values}%
\makebox[4.cm][l]{[Default]}O/C\hspace{1cm}Level\\
\hspace*{2.5cm}Description\\
\hspace*{2.5cm}Potential dependences


\begin{list}{$\bullet$}{}
\item \textbf{Variable name}: Name of the variable containing the keyword.

\item \textbf{Type}: a (Array), i (Integer), r (Real number), c
      (Character string).

\item \textbf{Allowed values}: list or range of allowed values.

\item \textbf{Default}: value defined by the code before any user
      modification (every keyword has one). In some cases, a
      non-allowed value is given (generally $-999$ or $-10^{12}$), forcing the
      user to specify a value. If he does not do it, the code may:
\begin{list}{-}{}
\item automatically use a recommended value (for example, automatic
      choice of the variables for which chronological records will be
      generated).

\item stop, if the keyword is essential.
\end{list}

\item \textbf{O/C}: Optional/Compulsory
\begin{list}{-}{}
\item O: optional keyword, whose default value may be enough.

\item C: keyword which must imperatively be specified.
\end{list}

\item \textbf{Level}: L1, L2 or L3
\begin{list}{-}{}
\item L1 (level 1): the users will have to modify it in the framework of
      standard applications. The L1 keywords are written in bold.

\item L2 (level 2): the users may have to modify it in the framework of
      advanced applications. The L2 keywords are all optional.

\item L3 (level 3): the developers may have to modify it; it keeps its
      default value in any other case. The L3 keywords are all optional.
\end{list}

\item \textbf{Description}:  keyword description, with its potential
      dependences.

\end{list}

The L1 keywords can be modified through the Graphical Use Interface or
in the \texttt{cs\_user\_parameters.f90} file. L2 and L3 keywords can only be modified through
the \texttt{cs\_user\_parameters.f90} file, even if they do not appear in the version proposed
as example it the \texttt{SRC/REFERENCE/base} directory.\\
It is however recommended not to modify the keywords which do not belong to the L1
level.

The alphabetical keyword list is displayed in the index, in the end of
this report.

\minititre{Notes}
$\bullet\ $The notation ``d'' refers to a double precision real. For
           instance, 1.8d-2 means 0.018. \\
$\bullet\ $The notation ``{\tt grand}'' (which can be used in the code)
corresponds to $10^{12}$.

\subsubsection{Post-processing for {\em EnSight} or other tools}
%==================================

\minititre{Notes}
$\bullet\quad$The format depends on the user choices, and most options
are defined using the GUI or \\
\texttt{cs\_user\_postprocess.c}.\\
$\bullet\quad$The post-processing files can be of the following formats: {\em Ensight Gold},
{\em MED} or {\em CGNS}. The use of the two latter formats depends on
the installation of the corresponding external libraries.\\
$\bullet\quad$For each quantity (problem unknown, preselected numerical
variable or preselected physical parameter), the user specifies if a
post-processing output is wanted. The output frequency can be set.\\

\motcleb{keyvis}{ifk}{field key, 0, 1, 2, or 3}{0}{O}{L1}
{for each quantity defined at the cell centres (physical or numerical
variable), indicator of whether it should be post-processed or not \\
\hspace*{1.3cm}= -999: not initialised. By default, the post-processed
quantities are the unknowns (pressure, velocity, $k$, $\varepsilon$,
$R_{ij}$, $\omega$, $\varphi$, $\overline{f}$, scalars), density,
turbulent viscosity and the time step if is not uniform\\
\hspace*{1.3cm}= 0: not post-processed\\
\hspace*{1.3cm}= 1: post-processed on main location\\
\hspace*{1.3cm}= 2: non-reconstructed values postprocessed on boundary if main location is cells\\
\hspace*{1.3cm}= 3: both 1 and 2\\
useful if and only if the variable is defined at the cell centers or boundary faces:
calculation variable, physical property (time step, density,
viscosity, specific heat) or turbulent viscosity if {\tt iturb}
$\geqslant$ 10}

%==================================
\subsubsection{Chronological records of the variables on specific points}
%==================================

\minititre{Standard use through Interface or \texttt{cs\_user\_parameters.f90}}
For each quantity (problem unknown, preselected numerical variable or
preselected physical parameter), the user indicates whether chronological records
should be generated, the output period and the position of the
probes. The code generates chronological records at the cell centers located
closest to the geometric points defined by the user by means of their
coordinates. For each quantity, the number of probes and their
index-numbers must be specified (it is not mandatory to generate all
the variables at all the probes).


\motcleb{ncapt}{i}{positive or null integer}{0}{O}{L1}
{total number of probes (limited to {\tt ncaptm}=200)\\
always useful }

\motcleb{xyzcap}{ra}{real numbers}{0.0}{O}{L1}
{3D-coordinates of the probes\\
the coordinates are written: {\tt xyzcap(i,j)}, with $i$ = 1, 2 or 3 and $j$
$\leqslant$ {\tt ncapt}\\
useful if and only if {\tt ncapt} $>$ 0}

\motcleb{ihisvr}{ia}{-999, -1 or positive or null integer}{-999}{O}{L1}
{number {\tt ihisvr(n, 1)} and index-numbers {\tt ihisvr(n, j$>$1)} of the recording
probes to be used for each variable, {\em i.e.} calculation variable
or physical property defined at the cell centers.
With {\tt ihisvr(n, 1)}=-999 or -1, {\tt ihisvr(n, j$>$1)} is useless.\\
\hspace*{.5cm} $\bullet$ {\tt ihisvr(n, 1)}: number of recording probes to use
for the variable N\\
\hspace*{1.3cm}= -999: default value: chronological records are generated on
all the probes if N is one of the main variables (pressure, velocity,
turbulence, scalars), the local time step or the turbulent
viscosity. For the other quantities, no chronological record is generated.\\
\hspace*{1.3cm}= -1: chronological records are produced on all the probes\\
\hspace*{1.3cm}= 0: no chronological record on any probe\\
\hspace*{1.3cm}$>0$: chronological record on {\tt ihisvr(n, 1)} probes to be
specified with  {\tt ihisvr(n, j$>$1)}\\
always useful, must be less than or equal to {\tt ncapt}\\
\hspace*{.5cm} $\bullet$ {\tt ihisvr(n, j$>$1)}: index-numbers of the probes
used for the variable $n$\\
(with $j \leqslant${\tt ihisvr(n,1)+1)}\\
\hspace*{1.3cm}= -999: by default: if {\tt ihisvr(n, 1)} $\ne$
-999, the  code stops. Otherwise, refer to the description of the case
{\tt ihisvr(n, 1)}=-999\\
useful if and only if {\tt ihisvr(n, 1)} $>$ 0 \\
The condition {\tt ihisvr(n, j)} $\leqslant${\tt ncapt} must be respected.\\
For ease to use, it is recommended to simply specify {\tt ihisvr(n,1)}=-1 for
all of the interesting variables.}

\motcle{emphis}{c}{string of less than 80 characters}{\tt ./}{O}{L3}
{directory in which potential chronological record files generated by
the Kernel will be written (path related to the execution directory)\\
it is recommended to keep the default value and, if necessary, to modify the
launch script to copy the files in the alternate destination directory\\
useful if and only if chronological record files are generated ({\em
i.e.} there is {\tt n} for which {\tt ihisvr(n, 1)} $\ne$ 0)}

\motcleb{nthist}{i}{-1 or strictly positive integer}{1 or -1}{O}{L1}
{output period of the chronological record files\\
\hspace*{1.3cm}= -1: no output\\
\hspace*{1.3cm}$>$ 0: period  (every {\tt nthist} time step)\\
The default value is -1 when there is no chronological record file to
generate (if there is no probe, {\tt ncapt} = 0, or if {\tt ihisvr(n, 1)}=0 for
all the variables) and 1 otherwise\\
If chronological records are generated, it is usually best to keep the default
value {\tt nthist}=1, in order to avoid missing any high frequency evolution (unless
the total number of time steps is too large to do so)\\
useful if and only if chronological record files are generated ({\em
i.e.} there are probes ({\tt ncapt}$>$0) or  there is {\tt n} for which
{\tt ihisvr(n, 1)} $\ne$ 0)}

\motcle{nthsav}{i}{-1 or positive or null integer}{0}{O}{L3}
{saving period the chronological record files (they are first stored in a
temporary file and then saved every {\tt nthsav} time step)\\
\hspace*{1.3cm}= 0: by default (4 times during a calculation)\\
\hspace*{1.3cm}= -1: saving at the end of the calculation\\
\hspace*{1.3cm}$>$ 0: period (every {\tt nthsav} time step)\\
During the calculation, the user can read the chronological record files
in the execution directory when they have been saved, {\em i.e.} at the first
time step, at the tenth time step and when the time step number is a multiple of
{\tt nthsav} (multiple of {\tt (ntmabs-ntpabs)/4} if {\tt nthsav}=0)\\
{\em Note: using the \texttt{control\_file} file enables to update the value of
{\tt ntmabs}. Hence, if the calculation is at the time step n, a save of the
chronological record files can be forced by changing {\tt ntmabs} to
{\tt ntpabs}+4(n+1)
using \texttt{control\_file}; after the files have been saved, {\tt ntmabs} can be
reset to its original value, still using \texttt{control\_file}.}\\
useful if and only if chronological record files are generated ({\em
i.e.} there are probes ({\tt ncapt}$>$0) there is {\tt n} for which
{\tt ihisvr(n, 1)} $\ne$ 0)}

\minititre{Non-standard use through \texttt{ushist}}
(see p.~\pageref{sec:prg_ushist})

\motcle{impush}{ia}{strictly positive integer}{33 to 32+\texttt{nushmx}=49}{O}{L3}
{units of the user chronological record files\\
useful if and only if the subroutine \texttt{ushist} is used}

\motcle{ficush}{ca}{strings of 13 characters}{\texttt{ush*} or
\texttt{ush*.n\_*}}{O}{L2}
{names of the user chronological record files.
In the case of a non-parallel calculation, the suffix applied the file
name is a three digit number: \texttt{ush001}, \texttt{ush002},
\texttt{ush003}...
In the case of a parallel-running calculation, the processor
index-number is added to the suffix. For instance, for a calculation
running on two processors:  \texttt{ush001.n\_0001},
\texttt{ush002.n\_0001}, \texttt{ush003.n\_0001}... and
\texttt{ush001.n\_0002},
\texttt{ush002.n\_0002}, \texttt{ush003.n\_0002}...
The opening, closing, format and location of these files must be managed
by the user.\\

\motcle{impusr}{ia}{strictly positive integer}{{\tt 70} to {\tt 69+nusrmx}=79}{O}{L3}
{unit numbers for potential user specified files\\
useful if and only if the user needs files (therefore always useful, by security)}

\motcleb{ficusr}{ca}{string of 13 characters}{\tt usrf* or usrf*.n\_*}{O}{L1}
{name of the potential user specified files. In the case of a non-parallel
calculation, the suffix applied the file name is a two digit number:
from \texttt{usrf01} to \texttt{usrf10}. In the case of a
parallel-running calculation, the four digit processor index-number is
added to the suffix. For instance, for a calculation running on two
processors: from \texttt{usrf01.n\_0001} to \texttt{usrf10.n\_0001} and
from \texttt{usrf01.n\_0002} to \texttt{usrf10.n\_0002}. The opening,

\motcleb{keylog}{ifk}{1 or 0}{-1}{O}{L1}
{for every quantity (variable, physical or numerical property ...),

\hspace*{1.3cm}= 1: writing in the execution listing.\\
\hspace*{1.3cm}= 0: no writing.\\

\motcleb{iwarni}{ia}{integer}{0}{O}{L1}
{{\tt iwarni(ivar)} characterises the level of detail of the outputs for the
variable {\tt ivar} (from 1 to {\tt nvar}). The quantity of information

Impose the value 0 or 1 for a reasonable listing size. Impose the value 2
to get a maximum quantity of information, in case of problem during the

\motcleb{nomvar}{ca}{string of less than 80 characters}{``''}{O}{L1}
{name of the variables (unknowns, physical properties ...): used in the
execution listing, in the post-processing files, etc.\\
{``''}: not initialised (the code chooses the manes by default)\\
It is recommended not to define variable names of more than 16
characters, to get a clear execution listing (some advanced writing
levels take into account only the first 16 characters).\\

\motcleb{ntlist}{i}{-1 or strictly positive integer}{1}{O}{L1}
{writing period in the execution report file\\
\hspace*{1.3cm}= -1: no writing\\
\hspace*{1.3cm}$>$ 0: period (every {\tt ntlist} time step)\\
The value of {\tt ntlist} must be adapted according to the number of iterations
carried out in the calculation. Keeping {\tt ntlist} to 1 will indeed provide
a maximum volume of information, but if the number of time steps is too large,
the execution report file might become too big and unusable
(problems with disk space, memory problems while opening the file with a text
editor, problems finding the desired information in the file, ...).\\

In case of a calculation using the control mode ({\tt inpdt0}=1), when the

physical properties and the boundary conditions are calculated. When
the calculation is a restart, the physical properties and the boundary
conditions are those read from the restart file (note: in the case of a
second-order time scheme, the mass flow is modified as if a normal
time step was realised: the mass flow generated in an potential
post-processing is therefore not the mass flow read from the restart file).\\
In the control mode ({\tt inpdt0}=1), the variable {\tt ntmabs} is not used.\\

When a particular physics module is activated (gas combustion, pulverised coal,

More precisely, everything is designed in the code to allow for the
running of a calculation coupled with \syrthes with the enthalpy as thermal
variable (the correspondence and conversion is then specified by the user in
the subroutine \texttt{usthht}).

The $k-\varepsilon$ (standard and linearized production) and $R_{ij}-\varepsilon$
(LRR and SSG) turbulence
models implemented in \CS are ``High-Reynolds'' models. It is therefore
necessary to make sure that the thickness of the first cell neighboring
the wall is larger than the thickness of the viscous sub-layer (at the
wall, $y^+>2.5$ is required as a minimum, and preferably between 30 and
100)\footnote{While creating the mesh, $y^+=\frac{yu*}{\nu}$ is
generally unknown. It can be roughly estimated as $\frac{yU}{10\nu}$, where
$U$ is the characteristic velocity, $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid
 and $y$ is the mid-height of the first cell near the wall.}. If the mesh does
 not respect this condition, the results may be biased
(particularly if thermal processes are involved). Using scalable wall-functions
(cf. keyword {\tt iwallf}) may help avoiding this problem.\\
The v2-f model is a ``Low-Reynolds'' model, it is therefore necessary to
make sure that the thickness of the first cell neighboring the wall is
smaller than the thickness of the viscous sub-layer ($y^+<1$).\\
The $k-\omega$ SST model provides correct results whatever the thickness of the first cell.
Yet, it requires the knowledge of the distance to the wall in every
cell of the calculation domain. The user may refer to the keyword
{\tt icdpar\index{icdpar}} for more details about the potential limitations.\\
The $k-\varepsilon$ model with linear production allows to correct the
known flaw of the standard $k-\varepsilon$ model which overestimates the
turbulence level in case of strong velocity gradients (stopping point).\\
With LES, the wall functions are usually not greatly adapted. It is generally more advisable
(if possible) to refine the mesh towards the wall so that the first cell is in the
viscous sub-layer, where the boundary conditions are simple natural no-slip conditions.\\
Concerning the LES model, the user may refer to the subroutine
\texttt{ussmag} for complements about the dynamic model. Its usage
and the interpretation of its results require particular attention.
In addition, the user must pay further attention when using the dynamic
model with the least squares method based on a partial extended
neighbourhood ({\tt imrgra}=3). Indeed, the results may be degraded if the user
does not implement his own way of averaging the dynamic constant in
\texttt{ussmag} (\textit{i.e.} if the user keeps the local average based
on the extended neighbourhood).\\

By default, the standard time scheme is a first-order.
A second-order scheme is activated automatically with LES modelling.
On the other hand, when ``specific physics'' (gas combustion, pulverised coal,
compressible module) are activated, the second-order scheme is not allowed.

In the current version, the second-order time scheme is not compatible
with the estimators ({\tt iescal}), the velocity-pressure coupling
({\tt ipucou}), the modelling of hydrostatic pressure ({\tt icalhy} and
{\tt iphydr}) and the time- or space-variable time step ({\tt idtvar}).

Also, in the case of a rotation periodicity, a proper second-order is not
ensured for the velocity, but calculations remain possible.

It is recommended to keep the default values of the variables listed
below. Hence, in standard cases, the user does not need to specify these
options.


\motcle{ischtp}{i}{1 or 2}{1 or 2}{O}{L2}
{{\tt ischtp} indicates the order of the
activated time scheme (this indicator allows the code to automatically complete
the other indicators related to the time scheme)\\
\hspace*{1.3cm}= 1: first-order \\
\hspace*{1.3cm}= 2: second-order \\
when {\tt ischtp}=2, the physical properties are by default not
second-order. It it possible to modify this by means of the
following indicators.\\
due to specific coupling between certain variables, the source terms in the
turbulence equations (except convection and diffusion) cannot be second order,
except with the $R_{ij}$ models (cf. keyword {\tt isto2t})\\
by default, {\tt ischtp} is initialised to 2 with the LES model and 1
otherwise\\

\motcle{istmpf}{i}{0, 1 or 2}{0 or 1}{O}{L3}
{{\tt istmpf} specifies the time scheme activated
for the mass flow. The chosen value for {\tt istmpf} will automatically
determine the value given to the variable {\tt thetfl}\\
\hspace*{1.3cm}= 0: ``explicit'' first-order: the mass flow calculated
at the previous time step (``n'') is used in the convective terms of all
the equations (momentum, turbulence and scalars\\
\hspace*{1.3cm}= 1: ``standard'' first-order: the mass flow calculated
at the previous time step (``n'') is used in the convective terms of the
momentum equation, and the updated mass flow (time ``n+1'') is used in the
equations of turbulence and scalars\\
\hspace*{1.3cm}= 2: second-order: the mass flow used in the momentum equations
is extrapolated at ``n+{\tt thetfl}'' (=n+1/2) from the values at the two former time
steps (Adams Bashforth); the mass flow used in the equations for turbulence and
scalars is interpolated at time ``n+{\tt thetfl}'' (=n+1/2) from the values at the
former time step and at the newly calculated ``n+1'' time step.\\
by default, {\tt istmpf}=2 is used in the case of a second-order time
scheme (if {\tt ischtp}=2) and {\tt istmpf}=1 otherwise\\

due to certain specific couplings between the turbulence equations,
{\tt isto2t} is allowed the value 1 or 2 only for the $R_{ij}$ models

When the density effects are important, the choice of
{\tt iphydr}=1 allows to improve the interpolation of the pressure and correct the
non-physical velocities which may appear in highly
stratified areas or near horizontal walls (thus
avoiding the use of {\tt extrag} if the non-physical velocities are due only to
gravity effects).\\
The improved algorithm also allows eradicating the velocity oscillations
which tend to appear at the frontiers of areas with high head losses.\\
In the case of a stratified flow, the calculation cost is higher when the
improved algorithm is used (about 30\% depending on the case) because
the hydrostatic pressure must be recalculated at the outlet boundary
conditions: see {\tt icalhy}.\\
On meshes of insufficient quality, in order to
improve the convergence, it may be useful to increase the number of
iterations for the reconstruction of the pressure right-hand side,
{\em i.e.} \mbox{\tt nswrsm(ipr)}.\\
If head losses are present just along an outlet boundary, it is necessary to

\subsubsection{Error estimators for Navier-Stokes}
%==================================

There are currently {\tt nestmx\index{nestmx}}=4 types of local estimators
provided at every time step, with two possible definitions for
each\footnote{Choice made by the user}. These scalars indicate the areas
(cells) in which some error types may be important. They are
stored in the array {\tt propce} containing the properties at the cells (see
{\tt iestim\index{iestim}}). For each estimator, the code writes the minimum and
maximum values in the listing and generates post-processing outputs along with
the other variables.

The additional memory cost is about one real number per cell and per
estimator. The additional calculation cost is variable. For instance, on a
simple test case, the total estimator {\tt iestot} generates an additional cost
of 15 to 20 $\%$ on the CPU time\footnote{Indeed, all the first-order in
space differential terms have to be recalculated at the time $t^{\,n+1}$};
the cost of the three others may be neglected. If the user wants to
avoid the calculation of the estimators during the computation, it is
possible to run a calculation without estimators first, and then activate them on
a restart of one or two time steps.

It is recommended to use the estimators only for visual and qualitative
analysis. Also, their use is compatible neither with a second-order time scheme
nor with a calculation with a frozen velocity field.

{\tt \bf iest = iespre\index{iespre}: prediction} (default name: EsPre).
After the velocity prediction step (yielding $\vect{\widetilde{u}}$), the
estimator $\eta^{\,pred}_{\,i,k}(\vect{\widetilde{u}})$, local variable calculated
at every cell $\Omega_i$, is created from $\vect{\mathcal
R}^{\,pred}(\vect{\widetilde{u}})$, which represents the residual of the equation
solved during this step:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{r c l}
\vect{\mathcal{R}}^{\,pred}(\vect{\widetilde{u}})&= & \rho^n
    \dfrac{\vect{\widetilde{u}}-\vect{u}^n}{\Delta t}
  + \gradt \left(\vect{\widetilde{u}} \right) \cdot \left(\rho  \vect{u}\right)^n
              - \divv \left((\mu+\mu_t)^n \gradt(\vect{\widetilde{u}}) \right)
              + \grad(P^n)     \\
              &- &\text{rest of the right-hand side}
                        (\vect{u}^n, P^n, \text{other variables}^n)
\end{array}
\end{equation*}

By definition:
$$ \eta^{\,pred}_{\,i,k}(\vect{\widetilde{u}})= {|\Omega_i|}^{\,(k-2)/2}\ ||\vect{\mathcal R}^{\,pred}(\vect{\widetilde{u}})||
_{{\mathbb{L}}^{2}(\Omega_i)}$$
%
\begin{itemize}
\item The first family, $k=1$, suppresses the
volume $|\Omega_i|$ which intrinsically appears with the norm
${{\mathbb{L}}^{2}(\Omega_i)}$.
\item The second family, $k=2$, exactly represents the norm
${{\mathbb{L}}^{2}(\Omega_i)}$. The size of the cell therefore
appears in its calculation and induces a weighting effect.
\end{itemize}
$ \eta^{\,pred}_{\,i,k}(\vect{\widetilde{u}})$  is ideally equal to zero when the
reconstruction methods are perfect and the associated system is
solved exactly.

{\tt \bf iest = iesder\index{iesder}: drift}  (default name: EsDer).
The estimator $\eta^{\,der}_{\,i,k}(\vect{u}^{\,n+1})$ is based on the
following quantity (intrinsic to the code):
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{lll}
 \eta^{der}_{i,k}(\vect{u}^{n+1})
&=& {|\Omega_i|}^{\,(k-2)/2}
||\divs \left(\text{corrected mass flow after the pressure step}\right)
                                              -\ \Gamma||_{{L}^{2}(\Omega_i)} \\
&=& {|\Omega_i|}^{\,(1-k)/2}
|div (\text{corrected mass flow after the pressure step})-\ \Gamma|
\end{array}
\end{equation}
Ideally, it is equal to zero when the Poisson equation related to the pressure is
solved exactly.

{\tt \bf iest = iescor\index{iescor}: correction}  (default name: EsCor).
The estimator $ \eta^{\,corr}_{\,i,k}(\vect{u}^{\,n+1})$ comes directly
from the mass flow calculated with the updated velocity field:
\begin{eqnarray*}
            \eta^{\,corr}_{\,i,k}(\vect{u}^{\,n+1})=
|\Omega_i|^{\,\delta_{\,2,k}}\ |div (\rho^n \vect{u}^{n+1}) -\ \Gamma|
\end{eqnarray*}
The velocities $\vect{u}^{n+1}$ are taken at the cell centers,
the divergence is calculated after projection on the faces.\\
            $ \,\delta_{\,2,k}$ represents the Kronecker symbol.\\
\hspace*{0.5cm}$\bullet$ The first family, $k=1$, is the absolute raw
value of the divergence of the mass flow minus the mass source term.\\
\hspace*{0.5cm}$\bullet$ The second family, $k=2$, represents a physical
property and allows to evaluate the difference in $kg.s^{\,-1}$.\\
Ideally, it is equal to zero when the Poisson equation is solved exactly and
the projection from the mass flux at the faces to the velocity at the cell
centers is made in a set of  functions with null divergence.

{\tt \bf iest = iestot\index{iestot}: total} (default name: EsTot).
The estimator $ \eta^{tot}_{\,i,k}(\vect{u}^{n+1})$, local variable
calculated at every cell $\Omega_i$, is based on the quantity
$\vect{\mathcal R}^{tot}(\vect{u}^{\,n+1})$, which represents the
residual of the equation using the updated values of
$\vect{u}$ and $P$:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{@{}r@{\,} c@{\,} l}
\vect{\mathcal{R}}^{tot}({\vect{u}^{n+1}})&= & \rho^n
    \dfrac{{\vect{u}^{n+1}}-\vect{u}^n}{\Delta t}
  + \gradt \left({\vect{u}^{n+1}} \right) \cdot {\left(\rho  \vect{u}\right)}^{n+1}
              - \divv \left((\mu+\mu_t)^n \gradt({\vect{u}^{n+1}}) \right)
              + \grad({P^{n+1}})     \\
              &- &\text{rest of the right-hand side}
                        ({\vect{u}^{n+1}}, {P^{n+1}}, \text{other variables}^n)
\end{array}
\end{equation*}
%
By definition:
$$ \eta^{tot}_{i,k}(\vect{u}^{n+1})= {|\Omega_i|}^{\,(k-2)/2}\ ||\vect{\mathcal R}^{tot}(\vect{u}^{\,n+1})||
_{\mathbb{L}^{2}(\Omega_i)}$$

The mass flux in the convective term is recalculated from $\vect{u}^{n+1}$
expressed at the cell centres (and not taken from the updated mass flow at the
faces).\\

As for the prediction estimator:
\begin{itemize}
\item The first family, $k=1$, suppresses the
volume $|\Omega_i|$ which intrinsicly appears  with the norm
${\mathbb{L}^{2}(\Omega_i)}$.
\item The second family, $k=2$, exactly represents the norm
${\mathbb{L}^{2}(\Omega_i)}$. The size of the cell therefore
appears in its calculation and induces a weighting effect.
\end{itemize}

The estimators are evaluated depending on the values of {\tt iescal}.


\motcleb{iescal}{ia}{0, 1 or 2}{0}{O}{L1}
{{\tt iescal(iest)} indicates the calculation mode
for the error estimator {\tt iest} ({\tt iespre}, {\tt iesder}, {\tt iescor} or

 {\tt iescal} = 1: the estimator $ \eta^{*}_{i,1}$ is calculated,
                   without contribution of the volume, \\
 {\tt iescal} = 2: the estimator $ \eta^{*}_{i,2}$ is calculated,
                   with contribution of the volume ("norm $L^2$"),

                   $|\Omega_i|\ \eta^{corr}_{i,1}\ $

\subsubsection{Calculation of the distance to the wall}
%==================================

\motcle{icdpar}{i}{-1, 1, -2 or 2}{-1}{O}{L2}
{specifies the method used to calculate the distance to the wall $y$ and the
non-dimensional distance $y^+$ for all the
cells of the calculation domain (when necessary):\\
\hspace*{1.3cm}= 1: standard algorithm (based on a Poisson equation for $y$ and
convection equation for $y^+$),
with reading of the distance to the wall from the restart file
if possible\\
\hspace*{1.3cm}=-1: standard algorithm (based on a Poisson equation for $y$ and
convection equation for $y^+$),
with systematic recalculation of the distance to the wall in case of
calculation restart\\
\hspace*{1.3cm}= 2: former algorithm (based on geometrical
considerations),
with reading of the distance to the wall from the restart file
if possible\\
\hspace*{1.3cm}=-2: former algorithm (based on geometrical
considerations) with systematic recalculation of the distance to the
wall in case of calculation restart\\
In case of restart calculation, if the position of the walls haven't changed,
reading the distance to the wall from the restart file can save a fair amount of
CPU time.\\
Useful in $R_{ij}-\varepsilon$ model with wall echo ({\tt iturb}=30 and
{\tt irijec}=1), in LES with van Driest damping ({\tt iturb}=40 and
{\tt idries}=1) and in $k-\omega$ SST ({\tt iturb}=60). \\
By default, {\tt icdpar} is initialised to -1, in case there has been a change in the
definition of the boundary conditions between two computations (change in the
number or the positions of the walls). Yet, with the $k-\omega$ SST model, the
distance to the wall is needed to calculate the turbulent viscosity, which is
done before the calculation of the distance to the wall. Hence, when this model
is used (and only in that case), {\tt icdpar} is set to 1 by default, to ensure total
continuity of the calculation at restart.\\
{\bf As a consequence, with the \boldmath$k-\omega$\unboldmath\ SST model, if
the number and positions of the walls are changed at a calculation restart, it
is mandatory for the user to set {\tt icdpar} explicitly to -1}, otherwise the
distance to the wall used will not correspond to the actual position of the
walls.\\
The former algorithm is not compatible with parallelism nor periodicity. Also,
whatever the value chosen for {\tt icdpar}, the calculation of the distance to the
wall is made at the most once for all a the beginning of the calculation; it is
therefore not compatible with moving walls. Please contact the development team
if you need to override this limitation.}

The following options are related to {\tt icdpar} $\neq$\ 0. The options of
level 2 are described first. Some options are used only in the case of
the calculation of the non-dimensional distance to the wall $y^+$ (LES model with
van Driest damping). Most of the following keywords are simple copies of the

reference values (see {\tt pred0} and {\tt p0}). Hence, the term
$-\grad{P}+\rho\vect{g}$ in the equation is treated as
$-\grad{P^*}+(\rho-\rho_0)\vect{g}$. The closer {\tt ro0} is to the value of $\rho$,
the more $P^*$ will tend to represent only the dynamic part of the pressure and
the faster and more precise its solution will be. Whatever the value of {\tt ro0},
both $P$ and $P^*$ appear in the listing and the post-processing outputs.\\
with the compressible module, the calculation is made directly on the total
pressure}

\motcleb{viscl0}{ra}{real number $>$ 0}{\tt -grand*10}{C}{L1}
{ {\tt viscl0} is the reference molecular dynamic

\motcleb{srrom}{r}{$0 \leqslant \text{real number} < 1$}{\tt -grand or 0}{c or O}{L1}

 is the sub-relaxation coefficient for the density, following the formula:\\
$\rho^{n+1}$\,=\,srrom\,$\rho^n$+(1-srrom)\,$\rho^{n+1}$\\
hence, with a zero value, there is no sub-relaxation.
With combustion and pulverised coal, {\tt srrom} is initialised to {\tt -grand}
and the user must specify a proper value through the Interface or the
initialisation subroutines (\texttt{cs\_user\_combustion}). With the electric module, {\tt srrom} is initialised in to 0
and may be modified by the user in \texttt{cs\_user\_parameters}.\\
With gas combustion, pulverised coal or electric arcs, {\tt srrom} is
automatically used after the second time-step.}\\

always useful}

\motcle{pred0}{ra}{real number}{0}{O}{L3}
{{\tt pred0} is the reference value for the reduced
pressure $P^*$ (see {\tt ro0})\\
it is especially used to initialise the reduced pressure and as a reference
value for the outlet boundary conditions\\
for an optimised precision in the resolution of $P^*$, it is better to keep {\tt pred0}
to 0\\
with the compressible module, the ``pressure'' variable appearing in the
equations directly represents the total pressure. It is therefore initialised
to {\tt p0} and not {\tt pred0} (see {\tt ro0})\\

{{\tt xyzp0(ii)} is the {\tt ii} coordinate

total pressure\\
when there are no Dirichlet conditions for the pressure (closed domain), {\tt xyzp0}
does not need to be specified (unless the total pressure has a clear physical
meaning in the configuration treated)\\
when Dirichlet conditions on the pressure are specified but only through standard
outlet conditions (as it is in most configurations),
{\tt xyzp0} does not need to be specified by the user, since it will be set to the
coordinates of the reference outlet face ({\em i.e.} the code will automatically
select a
reference outlet boundary face and set {\tt xyzp0} so that $P$ equals {\tt p0} at this
face). Nonetheless, if {\tt xyzp0} is specified by the user, the calculation will remain
correct\\
when direct Dirichlet conditions are specified by the user (specific value set
on specific boundary faces), it is better to specify the corresponding reference
point ({\em i.e.} specify where the total pressure is {\tt p0}). This way, the
boundary conditions for the reduced pressure will be close to {\tt pred0}, ensuring an
optimal precision in the resolution. If {\tt xyzp0} is not specified, the reduced
pressure will be shifted, but the calculations will remain correct.\\
with the compressible module, the ``pressure'' variable appearing in the

\subsection{Electric module (Joule effect and electric arcs): specificities}
%==================================

The electric module is composed of a Joule effect module
(\texttt{ippmod(ieljou)\index{ieljou}}) and an electric arcs module
(\texttt{ippmod(ielarc)\index{ielarc}}).

The Joule effect module is designed to take into account the Joule effect
(for instance in glass furnaces) with real or complex potential in the
enthalpy equation. The Laplace forces are not taken into account in the
impulse momentum equation. Specific boundary conditions can be applied to
account for the coupled effect of transformers (offset) in glass furnaces.

The electric arcs module is designed to take into account the Joule effect
(only with real potential) in the enthalpy equation. The Laplace forces
are taken into account in the impulse momentum equation.

The keywords used in the global settings are quite few. They are
found in the subroutine \texttt{cs\_user\_parameters}.

\motcleb{ielcor}{i}{0, 1}{0}{O}{L1}
{when \texttt{ielcor}=1, the boundary conditions for the potential will be
tuned at each time step in order to reach a user-specified target dissipated

the boundary condition tuning is controlled by subroutines \texttt{elreca} or

the variable \texttt{coejou}\\

\motcleb{puisim}{r}{real number $\geqslant 0$}{0}{O}{L1}

\motcleb{dpot}{r}{real number $\geqslant 0$}{0}{O}{L1}
{\texttt{dpot} is the potential difference ($V$) which generates the current (and the Joule effect) for the
calculations with boundary conditions tuning for the potential. This value is
initialised set by the user (\texttt{cs\_user\_parameters}). It is then automatically tuned
depending on the value of dissipated power (Joule effect module) or the
intensity of current (electric arcs module).
In order for the correct power or intensity to be reached, the boundary

horizontal walls when the flow is little convective.\\

Otherwise, when \texttt{icfgrp}=0, the pressure condition is calculated
from the solution of the one-dimensional Euler equations for a perfect

\subsection{Lagrangian multiphase flows}
%==================================================
\label{sec:prg_motscles_lagr}

Most of these keywords may be modified in the user subroutines
\texttt{uslag1}, \texttt{uslag2}, \texttt{uslaen},
\texttt{uslast} and \texttt{uslaed}. It is however strongly recommended
not to modify those belonging to the level L3.

First of all, it should be noted that the Lagrangian module is compliant with
almost all the RANS turbulence models and with laminar flows. However, the standard particle
turbulent dispersion model does not take fully advantage of the second-order
$R_{ij}-\varepsilon$ models. The same isotropic model is used as in the
$k-\varepsilon$ models, with $k$ calculated from the trace of $R_{ij}$. Also,
two-way coupling is not compatible with the $k-\omega$ SST model.

using the GUI, or the \texttt{cs\_user\_postprocess\_meshes} function of
\texttt{cs\_user\_postprocess.c}.

The following options determine which variables are output on those particle
or particle trajectory segment output meshes for which the ``automatic output''
is activated.

\motcleb{ivisv1}{i}{0, 1}{0}{O}{L1}
{associates (=1) or not (=0) the variable ``velocity of the locally
undisturbed fluid flow field'' with the output of particles or trajectories\\
always useful}

\motcleb{ivisv2}{i}{0, 1}{0}{O}{L1}
{associates (=1) or not (=0) the variable ``particle velocity''
with the output of particles or trajectories\\

\motcleb{iensi3}{i}{0, 1}{0}{C}{L1}
{activates (=1) or not (=0) of the recording of the particle/boundary
interactions in  \texttt{parbor\index{parbor}}, and of the calculation of the
statistics at the corresponding boundaries, for post-processing
(\textit{EnSight6} format)\\
By default, the statistics are unsteady (reset to zero at every
Lagrangian iteration). They may be steady if \texttt{isttio}=1 ({\em i.e.}
calculation of a cumulated value over time, and then calculation of an
average over time or over the number of interactions with the boundary)\\
always useful}

\motcleb{nstbor}{i}{strictly positive integer}{1}{O}{L1}
{number of absolute Lagrangian iterations (including the restarts)
after which the statistics at the boundaries are considered steady and are
averaged (over time or over the number of interactions)\\
If the number of absolute Lagrangian iterations is less than \texttt{nstbor},
or if \texttt{isttio}=0, the statistics are reset to zero at every
Lagrangian iteration (unsteady statistics)\\
useful if \texttt{iensi3}=1 and \texttt{isttio}=1}

\motcleb{seuilf}{r}{positive real number}{0}{O}{L1}
{every boundary face of the mesh undergoes a certain number of
interactions with particles, expressed in term of statistical weight
(sum of the statistical weights of all the particles which have
interacted with the boundary face). \texttt{seuilf} is
the limit statistical weight value, below which the contribution of the
face is not taken into account in the
statistics at the boundaries for post-processing\\

\motcleb{inbrbd}{i}{0, 1}{1}{O}{L1}
{activates (=1) or not (=0) of the recording of the number of particle/boundary

of additional boundary statistics in \texttt{parbor\index{parbor}}\\

{name of the boundary statistics, displayed in the listing
and the post-processing files\\
useful if \texttt{iensi3}=1\\

calculations, it will not be possible to read its value from the restart file}}

\motcleb{imoybr}{ia}{0, 1, 2}{0 , 1 or 2}{O}{L1}
{the recordings in \texttt{parbor} at every particle/boundary interaction are
cumulated values (possibly reset to zero at every iteration in the
unsteady case). They must therefore be divided by a quantity to
get boundary statistics. The user can choose between two average types:\\
\hspace*{1.3cm} = 0: no average is applied to the recorded cumulated values\\
\hspace*{1.3cm} = 1: a time-average is calculated. The cumulated value
is divided by the physical duration in the case of steady
averages (\texttt{isttio}=1). The cumulated value is divided by the value of
the last time step in the case of unsteady averages (\texttt{isttio}=0),
and also in the case of steady averages while the
absolute Lagrangian iteration number is inferior to \texttt{nstbor}\\
\hspace*{1.3cm} = 2: a particulate average is calculated. The cumulated
value is divided by the number of particle/boundary interactions (in terms of
statistical weight) recorded in \texttt{parbor(nfabor,inbr)}. This average
can only be calculated when \texttt{inbrbd}=1. The average is calculated if
the number of interactions (in statistical weight) of the considered
boundary face is strictly higher than \texttt{seuilf}, otherwise the average
at the face is set to zero\\
only the cumulated value is recorded in the restart file\\

{if the recording of the boundary statistics is steady, \texttt{tstatp}
contains the cumulated physical duration of the recording of the boundary
statistics\\
if the recording of the boundary statistics is unsteady, then
\texttt{tstat=dtp\index{dtp}} (it is the Lagrangian time step, because the
