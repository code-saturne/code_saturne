  \page us_vosy Examples of volume exchange coefficient computation for SYRTHES coupling (usvosy.f90)

   The \ref usvosy subroutine is used to compute a volume exchange
   coefficient for SYRTHES coupling.

  \section usvosy_h_usvosy Examples

  The following code blocks show two examples of computation of
  a volume exchange coefficient.

  \subsection usvosy_h_usvosy_arg Arguments of usvosy

  \snippet usvosy.f90 arg

  \subsection usvosy_h_usvosy_loc_var_dec Variable declaration

  \snippet usvosy.f90 loc_var_dec

  \subsection usvosy_h_usvosy_init Initialization

  The values of the different fields that will be needed for the computation of the
  volume exchange coefficient are retrieved.

  \snippet usvosy.f90 init

  \subsection usvosy_h_usvosy_1 Example 1

  The first example corresponds to a constant volume exchange coefficient.

  \snippet usvosy.f90 example_1

  \subsection usvosy_h_usvosy_2 Example 2

  The second example corresponds to a variable volume exchange coefficient
  defined as follows :

  \f[ h_{vol} = h_{surf} S \f]

  with S is the surface area where exchanges take place by unit of volume and

  \f[ h_{surf} = \frac{Nu \lambda}{L} \f]
