  \page cs_user_atmospheric_model Atmospheric model (cs_user_atmospheric_model.f90)

  \section cs_user_atmospheric_model_h_intro Introduction

  User subroutine for the atmospheric model.

  \section cs_user_atmospheric_model_usatdv Atmospheric module

  \c imode corresponds to the number of calls of the \ref usatdv function.
  Depending on the value of \c imode , different operations are performed
  in the following example.

  \subsection cs_user_atmospheric_model_usatdv_imode0 imode = 0

  \snippet cs_user_atmospheric_model.f90 imode_0

  \subsection cs_user_atmospheric_model_usatdv_imode1 imode = 1

  \snippet cs_user_atmospheric_model.f90 imode_1

  \section cs_user_atmospheric_model_usatsoil Data Entry for the atmospheric soil model

  To activate the model, the user has to set the and to specify the zone id
  on which the soil model is applied in \ref cs_user_parameters.c,
  routine \ref cs_user_model:
  \snippet cs_user_parameters-base.c atmo_soil_set

  Then the user may change default coefficient values for soil categories
  in \ref cs_user_parameters.f90, routine \ref usipsu
  \snippet cs_user_parameters.f90 usatsoil

  \section cs_user_atmospheric_initialization Initialization of atmospheric
  The user has to specify the percentage of each categories for all faces of
  the soil zone in \ref cs_user_initialization.c:
  \snippet cs_user_initialization-atmospheric.c atmo_soil_init
