  \section cs_user_lagr_boundary_conditions_h  Boundary conditions

  Lagrangian boundary conditions are based on boundary zone
  (\ref cs_boundary_zone_t) definitions. Additional information may be
  provided for Lagrangian boundary types and injections.

  As usual, definitions may be created using the GUI and extended
  with user functions.

  Access to the Lagrangian boundary conditions structure,
  which is necessary to most of the following examples, may be done as
  follows:

  \snippet cs_user_lagr_boundary_conditions.c lagr_bc_variables

  \subsection cs_user_lagr_boundary_conditions_h_zones  Boundary zones

  In this example, we assign rebound conditions to all boundary zones,
  except for an inlet and outlet type to specified zones.
  The type assigned is an integer based on the \ref cs_lagr_bc_type_t
  enumerator type.

  \snippet cs_user_lagr_boundary_conditions.c lagr_bc_define_type_1

  \subsection cs_user_lagr_boundary_conditions_h_injection  Injection sets

  In the following example, a first injection set for an inlet zone is defined.
  Note that newly injected particles may also be modified using the
  \ref cs_user_lagr_in function.

  \snippet cs_user_lagr_boundary_conditions.c lagr_bc_define_injection_1

  In the next example, a profile is assigned to the second injection set
  of an inlet zone (it is assumed this et was previously defined either
  through the GUI or user function).

  This requires first defining a profile definition function, matching
  the profile of \ref cs_lagr_injection_profile_compute_t.
  An example based on experimental profiles is given here:

  \snippet cs_user_lagr_boundary_conditions.c lagr_bc_profile_func_2

  Assigning the profile to the injection set simply requires
  assigning the function to the pointer in the injection set structure:

  \snippet cs_user_lagr_boundary_conditions.c lagr_bc_define_injection_2

  An optional user-defined input function may also be associated.

  \section cs_user_lagr_volume_conditions_h  Volume conditions

  Lagrangian volume conditions are based on volume zone
  (\ref cs_volume_zone_t) definitions. Additional information may be
  provided for Lagrangian injections.

  As usual, definitions may be created using the GUI and extended
  with user functions.

  Access to the Lagrangian volume conditions structure,
  which is necessary to most of the following examples, may be done as
  follows:

  \snippet cs_user_lagr_volume_conditions.c lagr_vol_cond_variables

  \subsection cs_user_lagr_volume_conditions_h_injection  Injection sets

  In the following example, we inject 1 particle set at each time step:
  \snippet cs_user_lagr_volume_conditions.c lagr_vol_define_injection_1

  \snippet cs_user_lagr_volume_conditions.c lagr_vol_define_injection_2
  In the following example, we inject 2 particle sets at computation
  initialization (i.e. at the first time step of a computation sequence
  in which the Lagrangian module is activated).
  Note that newly injected particles may also be modified using the
  \ref cs_user_lagr_in function.

  \snippet cs_user_lagr_volume_conditions.c lagr_vol_define_injection_2
