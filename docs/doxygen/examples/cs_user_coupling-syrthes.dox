  \page us_vosy Examples of volume exchange coefficient computation for SYRTHES coupling (cs_user_syrthes_coupling_volume_h)

   The \ref cs_user_syrthes_coupling_volume_h function is required to compute a volume exchange
   coefficient for SYRTHES coupling.

  \section cs_user_syrthes_coupling_volume_h Examples

  The following code blocks show two examples of computation of
  a volume exchange coefficient.

  \subsection cs_user_syrthes_coupling_volume_h_1 Example 1

  The first example corresponds to a constant volume exchange coefficient:

  \snippet cs_user_coupling-syrthes.c example_1

  \subsection cs_user_syrthes_coupling_volume_h_2 Example 2

  The second example corresponds to a variable volume exchange coefficient
  defined as follows :

  \f[ h_{vol} = h_{surf} S \f]

  with S is the surface area where exchanges take place by unit of volume and

  \f[ h_{surf} = \frac{Nu \lambda}{L} \f]

  First, the values of the different fields that will be needed for the
  computation of the volume exchange coefficient are retrieved.

  Then the coefficient can be computed and assigned to all cells.

  \snippet cs_user_coupling-syrthes.c example_2

  Not that in this example, no test is done on the coupling id
  or Syrthes instance name. The corresponding arguments
  can be used to apply specific computations in cas of multiple
  couplings.

  Also, although a test is done to check if the scalar behaves
  as a temperature regarding multiplication by Cp for more
  generality, the Syrthes volume coupling currently only handles
  the temperature variable.
