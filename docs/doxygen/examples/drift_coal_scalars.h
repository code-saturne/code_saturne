  \page drift_coal_scalars Data setting for drift scalars for coal combustion
 

  \section drift_coal_scalars_intro Introduction

  This page provides an example of code blocks that may be used
  to perform a calculation with drift scalars for coal combustion.

  \section cs_user_physical_properties-coal_drift Physical properties

  \subsection drift_coal_scalars_loc_var Local variables to be added

  The following local variables need to be defined for the examples
  in this section:

  \snippet cs_user_physical_properties-coal_drift.f90 loc_var_dec

  \subsection drift_coal_scalars_init Initialization and finalization

  The following initialization block needs to be added for the following examples:

  \snippet cs_user_physical_properties-coal_drift.f90 init

  In theory Fortran 95 deallocates locally-allocated arrays automatically,
  but deallocating arrays in a symmetric manner to their allocation is good
  practice, and it avoids using a different logic for C and Fortran.

  \subsection drift_coal_scalars_body Body

  Here is the corresponding code:
