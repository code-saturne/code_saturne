  \section radiat_activ Activation of the module

  The module can be activated in the \ref usppmo routine in
  \ref cs_user_parameters.f90. The corresponding keyword is \c iirayo in the
  \ref cs_glob_rad_transfer_params structure.

  This member can take the values:
   - \ref radiat::iirayo "iirayo" = 0: module desactivated.
   - \ref radiat::iirayo "iirayo" = 1: the module is activated and the Discrete
                                       Ordinates Method is used.
   - \ref radiat::iirayo "iirayo" = 2: the module is activated and the P1 model
                                       is used.

  \section radiat_param Radiation module specific parameters.

  When the module is activated, its specific input parameters should be set in
  the \ref cs_user_radiative_transfer_parameters function of the
  \ref cs_user_radiative_transfer.c file.

  \section cs_user_radiative_transfer_h_cs_user_radiative_transfer_parameters Calculation options for the radiative transfer module.

  Radiative transfer parameters may be defined using the
  \ref cs_user_radiative_transfer_parameters function.

  \section cs_user_radiative_transfer_h_boundary_conditions Radiative transfer boundary conditions

\image html radiative_tr_sketch.gif "Sketch of thermal flux in boundary walls"


The radiative boundary condition is based on the calculation of a new wall
temperature. This temperature is  computed with a thermal flux balance:

\f[{ Q_{conduction} = Q_{convection} + (Q_{rayt_{absorption}} - Q_{rayt_{emission}}}) \f]

Therefore :

\f[ \dfrac{xlamp}{epap}  (T_{fluid} - T_{wall})
= h_{fluid}  (T_{fluid} - T_{wall}) + epsp  (Q_{incid} - \sigma * T_{wall}) \f]


 \note In \c Code_Saturne the flux is positive when it is oriented from inside to outside.

  \subsection bound_faces Boundary faces identification

   Boundary faces may be identified using the \ref getfbr function,
   or preferrably, through boundary zones, defined using the
   GUI or the \ref cs_user_zones function..

\subsection init_fin Initialization and finalization

The following declaration and initialization block needs to be added
for the following examples:

\snippet cs_user_radiative_transfer_bcs.c loc_var

<b> Remaining initialisation</b>

ivar: number of the thermal variable

\snippet cs_user_radiative_transfer_bcs.c ivar

Min and Max values for the wall temperatures (clipping otherwise)

\f$ T_{min} \f$ and \f$T_{max} \f$ are given in Kelvin.

\snippet  cs_user_radiative_transfer_bcs.c temp

\subsection assign2 Assign boundary conditions to boundary wall

\section cs_user_radiative_transfer_bcs_zones  Zone definitions

For each boundary face face_id, a specific output (logging and
postprocessing) zone id may be assigned. This allows realizing balance
sheets by treating them separately for each zone. By default, the
output zone id is set to the general (input) zone id associated to a face.

To access output zone ids (both for reading and modifying), use the
\ref cs_rad_transfer_get_output_b_face_zone_ids function.
The zone id values are arbitrarily chosen by the user, but must be
positive integers; very high numbers may also lead to higher memory
consumption.

\paragraph wall_carac Wall characteristics

\warning The unit of the temperature is the Kelvin

\paragraph manda Mandatory data

  - \c isothp(ifac) boundary face type
              -  \c itpimp -> Gray wall with fixed inside temperature
              -  \c ipgrno -> Gray wall with fixed outside temperature
              -  \c iprefl -> Reflecting wall with fixed outside temperature
              -  \c ifgrno -> Gray wall with fixed conduction flux
              -  \c ifrefl -> Reflecting wall with fixed conduction flux

  - \c tintp(ifac) inside wall temperature (Kelvin)
                   initialize thwall at the first time step.
                   If \c isothp = \c itpimp, the value of thwall is fixed to \c tintp
                   In the other case, \c tintp is only for initialization.
\paragraph data Other data (depending of the isothp)

  - \c rcodcl = conduction flux
  - \c epsp   = emissivity
  - \c xlamp  = conductivity (\f$W.m^{-1}.K^{-1}\f$)
  - \c epap   = thickness (\f$m\f$)
  - \c textp  = outside temperature (\f$K\f$)


\subsection ex Examples of boundary conditions

Here is a list of examples:

  \subsubsection ex1 Gray or black wall with profil of fixed inside temperature

  For wall boundary faces, selection criteria: color 1  \n

  \snippet   cs_user_radiative_transfer_bcs.c  example_1


  \subsubsection ex2 Gray or black wall with fixed outside temperature \f$ T_{ext} \f$

  For wall boundary faces, selection criteria: color 2  \n

  \snippet  cs_user_radiative_transfer_bcs.c example_2


  \subsubsection ex3 Reflecting wall (\f$ epsp = 0 \f$) with fixed outside temperature \f$ T_{ext} \f$

  For wall boundary faces, selection criteria: color 3 \n

  \snippet  cs_user_radiative_transfer_bcs.c example_3


  \subsubsection ex4 Gray or black wall and fixed conduction flux through the wall

For wall boundary faces which have the color 4: \n

\f[
\begin{array}{rcl}
\frac{\texttt{xlamp}}{\texttt{epap}} \cdot (T_{wall} - T_{ext})
&=& \text{fixed conduction flux in } W.m^{-2} \\
&=& \texttt{rodcl(ifac,ivar,3)}
\end{array}
\f]

If the conduction flux is zero then the wall is adiabatic. The array \f$ \texttt{rcodcl(ifac,ivar,3)}\f$ has the value of the flux. \n
Flux density (< 0 if gain for the fluid)
 - For temperature \f$T\f$, in \f$ W.m^{-2}\f$:

 \f[ rcodcl(ifac,ivar,3)=C_p (viscls+\frac{visct}{\sigma})\cdot \grad{T}\cdot \vect{n} \f]

 - For enthalpy \f$h\f$, in \f$ W.m^{-2} \f$:
 \f[ RCODC(IFAC,IVAR,3)=(viscls+\frac{visct}{\sigma})\cdot \grad{H} \cdot \vect{n}\f]

\f[
\frac{xlamp}{epap} \cdot (T_{wall} - T_{ext}) = \text{fixed conduction flux}
\f]
and \f$ epsp = 0 \f$

If the conduction flux is zero then the wall is adiabatic.
 Flux density (< 0 if gain for the fluid)
  - For temperatures \f$T\f$,    in \f$ W.m^{-2} \f$:
    \f[  rcodcl(ifac,ivar,3) = C_p  (viscls+\frac{visct}{\sigma}) \cdot \grad{T}\cdot \vect{n} \f]
  - For enthalpies \f$h\f$,      in \f$ W.m^{-2} \f$:
    \f[  rcodcl(ifac,ivar,3) =    (viscls+\frac{visct}{\sigma})  \cdot \grad{H} \cdot \vect{n} \f]
