  \page drift_scalars Data setting for drift scalars

  \section drift_scalars_intro Introduction

  This page provides an example of code blocks that may be used
  to perform a calculation with drift scalars.

  \section cs_user_physical_properties-scalar_drift Physical properties

  \subsection drift_scalars_loc_var Local variables to be added

  The following local variables and associated initializations
  need to be defined for the examples in this section:

  \snippet cs_user_physical_properties-scalar_drift.c init

  \subsection drift_scalars_body Body

  This example sets the scalar laminar diffusivity (for Brownian motion)
  to take thermophoresis into account.

  Here is the corresponding code:

  \snippet cs_user_physical_properties-scalar_drift.c example_1
