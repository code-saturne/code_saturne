  \page cs_user_modules Creating user arrays (cs_user_modules.f90)

  \section cs_user_module_h_intro Introduction

  User subroutine for the definition of a user module. The following example
  illustrates the creation of user arrays called \c rwork and \c iwork.

  \section cs_user_module_h_variable Arrays declaration

  The first step is to declare these two arrays at the very
  beginning of the module. The first one \c iwork is an allocatable
  array of one dimension whereas \c rwork is a pointer to a bidimensionnal
  array.

  \section cs_user_module_h_allocate Arrays allocation

  The \ref init_user_module subroutine allocates \c rwork and \c iwork if they
  are not already allocated or associated (for \c rwork).

  \snippet cs_user_modules-user-arrays.f90 allocate

  \section cs_user_module_h_c_pointer Access to arrays in C

  It is possible to access the \c rwork array in the C part of the code.
  This can be done by using the \ref get_user_module_rwork subroutine.

  \section cs_user_module_h_free Arrays freeing

  Eventually, the \ref finalize_user_module subroutine is used to free
  \c iwork and \c rwork.
