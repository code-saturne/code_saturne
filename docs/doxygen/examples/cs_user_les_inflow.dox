  \page les_inflow Generation of synthetic turbulence at LES inlets

  \section cs_user_les_infow_intro Introduction

  Generation of  synthetic turbulence at LES inlets can be defined using
  the \ref cs_user_les_inflow_define user function, and possibly
  updated using \ref cs_user_les_inflow_update, with
  \ref cs_user_les_inflow_advanced allowing for finer definition of
   target statistics the inlet if needed.

  \section cs_user_les_inflow_init Global caracteristics of synthetic turbulence inlets

  \subsection user_les_inflow_general General settings

  The \ref cs_user_les_inflow_define function is the main entry point
  for LES inflow definitions.

  It can be used to set general options, such as the specific
  checkpoint/restart behavior, as in the following example:

  \snippet cs_user_les_inflow-base.c set_restart

  \subsection user_les_inflow_define_inlets Defining inlet properties

  For each LES inlet, the \ref cs_les_inflow_add_inlet
  must be used.

  For example, to use the Batten Method for boundary faces of
  a zone named INLET_1:

  \snippet cs_user_les_inflow-base.c init_1

  And to use the Synthetic Eddy Method for boundary faces of
  a zone named INLET_2:

  \section cs_user_les_inflow_modify Modifying synthetic turbulence inlets

  \subsection user_les_inflow_update Updating base characteristics

  To update reference velocity, turbulent kinetic energy, or dissipation
  rate for a given turbulence inlet,
  the \ref cs_user_les_inflow_update function may be used.
  It is called automatically for each LES inlet defined previously.

  The following example illustrates modifying values for the example
  zone named INLET_1:

  \snippet cs_user_les_inflow-base.c update_1

  \subsection cs_user_les_inflow_example_1 Advanced LES inlet Example 1

  Mean velocity, Reynolds stresses an dissipation are deduced from a wall law
  for the zone named INLET_1 (no modification of
  the statistics of the flow is provided for the other synthetic
  turbulence inlets).

  \snippet cs_user_les_inflow-base.c example_1

  \subsection cs_user_les_inflow_example_2 Advanced LES Example 2

  Reynolds stresses and dissipation at the inlet are computed
  using the turbulence intensity and standard laws for
  a circular pipe for for the zone named INLET_1 (no modification of
  the statistics of the flow is provided for the other synthetic
  turbulence inlets).
