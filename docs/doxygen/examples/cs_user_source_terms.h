   \page subroutine_ustsnv For velocity components equation (Navier-Stokes): ustsnv subroutine

 \brief Additional right-hand side source terms for velocity components equation
 (Navier-Stokes)

  \section use_src1  Usage

  The additional source term is decomposed into an explicit part \f$(\vect{crvexp})\f$ and
  an implicit part \f$(\tens{crvimp})\f$ that must be provided here.
  The resulting equation solved by the code for a velocity is:
  \f[
  \rho \norm{\vol{\celli}} \DP{\vect{u}} + ....
   = \tens{crvimp}\cdot  \vect{u} + \vect{crvexp}
  \f]

  Note that \f$\vect{crvexp}\f$ and \f$\tens{crvimp}\f$ are defined after the Finite Volume integration
  over the cells, so they include the \f$\norm{\vol{\celli}}\f$ term. More precisely:
   - \f$\vect{crvexp}\f$ is expressed in \f$ kg\cdot ms^{-2} \f$
   - \f$\tens{crvimp}\f$ is expressed in \f$ kg\cdot s^{-1} \f$

  The \f$\vect{crvexp}\f$ and \f$\tens{crvimp}\f$ arrays are already initialized to 0
  before entering the
  the routine. It is not needed to do it in the routine (waste of CPU time).

  For stability reasons, \c Code_Saturne will not add \c -crvimp directly to the
  diagonal of the matrix, but \c Max(-crvimp,0). This way, the \f$ \tens{crvimp}\f$ term  is
  treated implicitely only if it strengthens the diagonal of the matrix.
  However, when using the second-order in time scheme, this limitation cannot
  be done anymore and \c -crvimp is added directly. The user should therefore test
  the negativity of \c crvimp by himself.

  When using the second-order in time scheme, one should supply:
   - \f$\vect{crvexp}\f$ at time n
   - \f$\tens{crvimp}\f$ at time n+1/2

  The selection of cells where to apply the source terms is based on a
  \ref getcel command. For more info on the syntax of the \ref getcel command,
  refer to the user manual or to the comments on the similar command
  \ref getfbr in the routine \ref cs_user_boundary_conditions.

In theory Fortran 95 deallocates locally-allocated arrays automatically, but deallocating arrays in a symetric manner to their alloacation is good pratice, and avoids using a different logic C and Fortran.

Example of arbitrary source term for component \f$\vect{u}\f$:

   \f$ \vect{S} = \tens{A} \cdot \vect{u} + \vect{B} \f$ appearing in the equation under the form:

   \f$ \rho \dfrac{d\vect{u}}{dt} = \vect{S} \: (+ \text{standard Navier-Stokes terms})\f$


In the following example:
  \f[  \tens{A} = -\rho \cdot \tens{CKP} \f]
  \f[  \vect{B} =  \vect{XMMT}  \f]

with:
 - <tt> CKP = 1.d0 </tt>(in \f$ s^{-1}\f$) (return term on velocity) \n
 - <tt> MMT = 100.d0 </tt>(in \f$kg \cdot m^{-2} \cdot s^{-2}\f$) (momentum production by volume and time unit)

which yields:
 - <tt>  crvimp(1, 1, iel) = volume(iel)* A = - volume(iel)*(rho*CKP )</tt> \n
 - <tt>  crvexp(1, iel) = volume(iel)* B = volume(iel)*(XMMT) </tt>

   \page subroutine_ustssc For transported scalar: ustssc subroutine


 \brief The routine is called for each scalar, user or specific physisc. It is
        therefore necessary to test the value of the scalar number iscal to separate
        the treatments of the different scalars <tt>(if (iscal.eq.p) then ....)</tt>.

        The additional source term is decomposed into an explicit part \f$ (crvexp) \f$ and
        an implicit part \f$ (crvimp) \f$ that must be provided here.
        The resulting equation solved by the code for a scalar \f$f\f$ is:

  \f[ \rho \norm{\vol{\celli}}\frac{df}{dt} + .... = crvimp \cdot f + crvexp  \f]


 \note that \f$ crvexp \f$ and \f$ crvimp\f$ are defined after the Finite Volume integration
 over the cells, so they include the \f$\norm{\vol{\celli}}\f$ term. More precisely:
   - \f$ crvexp\f$ is expressed in \f$ kg\cdot [scal] \cdot s^{-1} \f$ , where \f$ [scal] \f$ is the unit of the scalar
   - \f$ crvimp\f$ is expressed in \f$ kg \cdot s^{-1} \f$


 The \f$ crvexp \f$ and \f$ crvimp\f$ arrays are already initialized to 0 before entering the
 the routine. It is not needed to do it in the routine (waste of CPU time).

 For stability reasons, \c Code_Saturne will not add \c -crvimp directly to the
 diagonal of the matrix, but <tt> Max(-crvimp,0).</tt> This way, the \c crvimp term is
 treated implicitely only if it strengthens the diagonal of the matrix.
 However, when using the second-order in time scheme, this limitation cannot
 be done anymore and \c -crvimp is added directly. The user should therefore test
 the negativity of \c crvimp by himself.

 When using the second-order in time scheme, one should supply:
   - \c crvexp at time n
   - \c crvimp at time n+1/2


 The selection of cells where to apply the source terms is based on a \ref getcel
 command. For more info on the syntax of the \ref getcel command, refer to the
 user manual or to the comments on the similar command \ref getfbr in the routine
 \ref cs_user_boundary_conditions.

 \warning  If the scalar is the temperature, the resulting equation
          solved by the code is:

  \f[ \rho C_p \norm{\vol{\celli}} \frac{dT}{dt} + .... = crvimp \cdot T + crvexp \f]


 \note \f$crvexp\f$ and \f$ crvimp\f$ are defined after the Finite Volume integration
 over the cells, so they include the \f$\norm{\vol{\celli}}\f$ term. More precisely:
   - \f$crvexp\f$ is expressed in \f$ W \f$
   - \f$crvimp\f$ is expressed in \f$ W \cdot K^{-1} \f$


   \section steep Steep source terms

 In case of a complex, non-linear source term, say \f$ F(f) \f$, for scalar \f$ f \f$, the
 easiest method is to implement the source term explicitely.

   \f[ \frac{df}{dt} = .... + F(f^{(n)}) \f]
   where \f$ f^{(n)} \f$ is the value of \f$f\f$ at time \f$t^n\f$, the beginning of the time step.

 This yields :
  - <tt> crvexp = volume*F(f(n)) </tt>
  - <tt> crvimp = 0 </tt>

 However, if the source term is potentially steep, this fully explicit
 method will probably generate instabilities. It is therefore wiser to
 partially implicit the term by writing:

   \f[ \frac{df}{dt} = .... + \frac{dF}{df} f^{(n+1)} - \frac{dF}{df} f^{(n)} + F(f^{(n)}) \f]

 This yields:
   - <tt> crvexp = volume*( F(f(n)) - dF/df*f(n) ) </tt>
   - <tt> crvimp = volume*dF/df </tt>

Example of arbitrary source term for the scalar f, 2nd scalar in the calculation.

  \f$ S=A \cdot f+B \f$

appearing in the equation under the form

In the following example:

\f[A=-\frac{\rho}{\tau_f} \f]
\f[B=\rho \cdot prod_f \f]

with:
 - tauf = 10.d0 (in \f$ s \f$) (dissipation time for \f$f\f$)
 - prodf = 100.d0 (in \f$ [f]\cdot s^{-1} \f$) (production of \f$f\f$ by unit of time)

which yields:
 - <tt> crvimp(iel) = volume(iel)*A = -volume(iel)*rho/tauf </tt>
 - <tt> crvexp(iem) = volume(iel)*B= volume(iel)*rho*prod_f </tt>

Example of arbitrary volumic heat term in the equation for enthalpy h.


 In the considered example, a uniform volumic source of heating is imposed
 in the cells with coordinate X in [0;1.2] and Y in [3.1;4].

 The global heating power if \c Pwatt (in \f$W\f$) and the total volume of the
 selected cells is \c volf (in \f$m^3\f$).

 This yields:

   \warning It is assumed here that the thermal scalar is an enthalpy. If the scalar is a  temperature. PWatt does not need to  be divided by \f$ C_p \f$ because \f$C_p\f$ is put outside thediffusion term and multiplied in the temperature equation as follows:
 \f[ \rho C_p \norm{\vol{\celli}} \frac{dT}{dt} + ... = \norm{\vol{\celli}(iel)} \frac{pwatt}{voltf} \f]

   \page subroutine_cs_user_turbulence_source_terms For turbulence model: cs_user_turbulence_source_terms subroutine

   \brief Additional right_hand side source terms for turbulence models

   \section use_src3 Usage

 The additional source term is decomposed into an explicit part \f$(crvexp)\f$ and an implic it part \f$(crvimp)\f$ that must be provided here. The resulting equations solved by the code are:

\f[
  \rho \norm{\vol{\celli}} \DP{\varia} + ....
   = crvimp \cdot \varia + crvexp
 \f]
 where \f$ \varia \f$ is the turbulence field of index \f$ f_{id} \f$.

 \note \f$ crvexp \text{, } crvimp\f$ are defined after the Finite Volume
 integration over the cells, so they include the \f$\norm{\vol{\celli}}\f$ term. More precisely:
   - \f$crvexp\f$ is expressed in \f$ kg\cdot m^{-2} \cdot s^{-2} \f$
   - \f$crvimp\f$ is expressed in \f$ kg \cdot s^{-1} \f$

 The \f$crvexp\f$, \f$crvimp\f$ arrays are already initialized to 0 before
 entering the routine. It is not needed to do it in the routine (waste of CPU time).

 For stability reasons, \c Code_Saturne will not add \c -crvimp directly to the
 diagonal of the matrix, but \c Max(-crvimp,0). This way, the \c crvimp term is
 treated implicitely only if it strengthens the diagonal of the matrix.
 However, when using the second-order in time scheme, this limitation cannot
 be done anymore and \c -crvimp is added directly. The user should therefore test
 the negativity of \c crvimp by himself.

 When using the second-order in time scheme, one should supply:
   - \f$crvexp\f$ at time n
   - \f$crvimp\f$ at time n+1/2

 The selection of cells where to apply the source terms is based on a \ref getcel
 command. For more info on the syntax of the \ref getcel command, refer to the
 user manual or to the comments on the similar command \ref getfbr in the routine
 \ref cs_user_boundary_conditions.
