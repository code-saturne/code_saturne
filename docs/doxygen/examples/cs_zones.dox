  \page cs_user_zones_examples Volume and boundary zone definitions (cs_user_zones.c)

  Volume and boundary zones may be defined using the GUI, or through
  the \ref cs_user_zones (in cs_user_zones.c).

  \section cs_user_zones_volume_simple Simple volume zone example

  Most zones may be defined in a simple manner using the general
  \ref sec_selection_criteria "selection criteria", such as in the following
  example:

  \snippet cs_user_zones.c user_zones_head_loss_1

  Or you can define 3 spherical source term zones based on geometrical criteria
  described by a rule.

  \snippet cs_user_zones.c user_zones_volume_1

  \section cs_user_zones_volume_advanced Advanced volume zone examples

  More complex selections can be done by defining an appropriate selection
  function. For example, to select cells adjacent to boundary faces belonging
  to a group named "G3", the following selection function must first be defined:

  \snippet cs_user_zones.c select_func_vol2

  It can then simply be used in a zone definition:

  \snippet cs_user_zones.c user_zones_volume_2

  \remark If defined as "static", as in this example, an with no function
          prototype, the selection function must be defined in the same file
          (i.e. cs_user_zones.c), and appear before the definition of
          \ref cs_user_zones. If a appropriate selection function is
          available in another source file, it must have non-static linkage
          an a function prototype must be provided (usually through an
          associated .h file).

  \section cs_user_zones_boundary_advanced Advanced boundary zone examples

  You can define simple boundary zones, allowing all faces not in the
  "INLET" or "OUTLET" groups to be considered as walls

  \snippet cs_user_zones.c user_zones_boundary_1

  Or simply allow overlapping for an existing zone:

  \snippet cs_user_zones.c user_zones_boundary_2
