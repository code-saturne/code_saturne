  \section cs_user_atmospheric_model_h_intro Introduction

  User subroutine for the atmospheric model.

  \section cs_user_atmospheric_model_usatdv Atmospheric module

  \c imode corresponds to the number of calls of the \ref usatdv function.
  Depending on the value of \c imode , different operations are performed
  in the following example.

  \subsection cs_user_atmospheric_model_usatdv_imode0 imode = 0

  \snippet cs_user_atmospheric_model.f90 imode_0

  \subsection cs_user_atmospheric_model_usatdv_imode1 imode = 1

  \snippet cs_user_atmospheric_model.f90 imode_1

  \section cs_user_atmospheric_model_usatsoil Data Entry for the atmospheric ground model
