  \page user_ht_convert Examples of enthalpy-temperature conversion law

  \section ht_convert_intro Introduction

  By default, when not using a specific physical model (which
  will usually contain a more advanced conversion), a simple
  \f[ H = C_p T \f] law is used.

  This simple law will also be used by default in solid zones even
  when using a specific fluid model.

  When using variable Cp values, an appropriate temperaure to enthalpy
  conversion should be defined by the user if solving the Enthalpy.

  The \ref cs_user_physical_properties_h_to_t and
  \ref cs_user_physical_properties_t_to_h functions (in
  \ref cs_user_physical_properties.c) can be used to define an
  enthalpy-temperature conversion law and its inverse.

  If can be defined on a "per-zone" basis if needed in case different
  zones (both solid and boundary) correspond to different fluids
  or solid ones.

  \section user_ht_convert_ex Example

  The following code blocks show an example of enthalpy-temperature
  conversion law.

  \subsection user_ht_convert_tab Tabulation

  The following block is added either outside
  \ref cs_user_physical_properties_h_to_t and
  \ref cs_user_physical_properties_t_to_h functions (before all function
  definitions in \ref cs_user_physical_properties.c), or in both
  of these functions:

  \snippet cs_user_physical_properties.c tabulation

  \subsection user_ht_convert_h_to_t Enthalpy to temperature

  The following block is then used in \ref cs_user_physical_properties_h_to_t
  to convert enthalpy to temperature:

  \snippet cs_user_physical_properties.c z_h_to_t

  Note that \c z->name or \c z->location_id can be used as a filter
  if "per-zone" properties are needed (such as with solid zones).

  \subsection user_ht_convert_t_to_h Temperature to Enthalpy

  The following block must then be added in
  \ref cs_user_physical_properties_t_to_h for the matching
  temperature to Enthalpy conversion:

  \snippet cs_user_physical_properties.c z_t_to_h

  Note that temperature to enthalpy conversion is only needed
  when solving the Enthalpy and using radiative tranfers or
  temperature-based boundary conditions.
