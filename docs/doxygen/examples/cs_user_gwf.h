  \page cs_user_gwf_cdo Settings soils and tracers for the groundwater flow module with CDO schemes (cs_user_gwf.c)

  The add of a new soil or a new tracer takes place in \ref
  cs_user_model (see \ref cs_user_parameters_h_cdo_gwf for more
  details).

  \section cs_user_gwf_h_soil Soils

  Example for a saturated soil defined by an isotropic permeability.

  \snippet cs_user_gwf-example.c param_cdo_gwf_set_soil

  \ref cs_gwf_set_aniso_saturated_soil sets a saturated soil defined
  by an anisotropic permeability. Soils which behave according to a
  Van Genuchten model can be specified using \ref
  cs_gwf_set_aniso_genuchten_soil or \ref
  cs_gwf_set_iso_genuchten_soil. More advanced definition using a
  user-defined model is also possible using \ref cs_gwf_set_user_soil.

  \section cs_user_gwf_h_tracer Tracers

  Here is an example for a standard tracer.
