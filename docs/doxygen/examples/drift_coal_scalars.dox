  \page drift_coal_scalars Data setting for drift scalars for coal combustion

  \section drift_coal_scalars_intro Introduction

  This page provides an example of code blocks that may be used
  to perform a calculation with drift scalars for coal combustion.

  \section cs_user_physical_properties-coal_drift Physical properties

  \subsection drift_coal_scalars_init Initialization and finalization

  The following initialization block needs to be added for the
  following examples:

  \snippet cs_user_physical_properties-coal_drift.c init

  \subsection drift_coal_scalars_body Body

  Here is the corresponding code:

  \snippet cs_user_physical_properties-coal_drift.c example_1
