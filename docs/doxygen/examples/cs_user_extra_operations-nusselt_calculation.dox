  \page cs_user_extra_operations_examples_nusselt_calculation_p Calculation of a local Nusselt number

  This is an example of \ref cs_user_extra_operations function which computes a
  local Nusselt number.

  \section loc_var_f_user Local variables

  Faces can be selected either using a selector (as is done here) or directly
  using boundary zone element ids if an appropriate zone has been defined.

  \snippet cs_user_extra_operations-nusselt_calculation.c loc_var_f_user

  \subsection compute_nusselt Reconstruct value at selected boundary faces

  Allocate a local array for the selected boundary faces.
  \snippet cs_user_extra_operations-nusselt_calculation.c compute_nusselt

  \subsection general_nusselt General case (for non-orthogonal meshes)
  \snippet cs_user_extra_operations-nusselt_calculation.c gen_nusselt

  \subsection orthogonal_nusselt Case of orthogonal meshes

  Compute boundary value without reconstruction
  \snippet cs_user_extra_operations-nusselt_calculation.c else_nusselt

  \note Here, we assign the non-reconstructed value.

  Open file to print values and broadcast values to all parallel ranks.
  Values are ordered by the \c xabs array
  values provided to the \ref cs_parall_allgather_ordered_r, so this function
  is needed even when not running in parallel.

  \snippet  cs_user_extra_operations-nusselt_calculation.c value_ortho_nusselt

  Compute the bulk temperature, finalize the Nusselt number, print it and
  free memory not already freed before:

  \snippet cs_user_extra_operations-nusselt_calculation.c  bulk_nusselt
