  \page us_thht Examples of enthalpy-temperature conversion law (usthht.f90)

   The \ref usthht subroutine is used to encapsulate a simple
   enthalpy-temperature conversion law and its inverse.

  \section usthht_h_intro Introduction

  The \ref usthht function allows one to define a simple
  enthalpy-temperature conversion law and its inverse. The
  parameters \c mode allows one to know in which direction
  the conversion will be made.

  \section usthht_h_usthht Examples

  The following code blocks show two examples of entahlpy-temperature
  conversion law.

  \subsection usthht_h_usthht_1 Example 1

  The first example corresponds to a simple law : \f[H = C_p  dt \f]

  \snippet usthht.f90 example_1

  \subsection usthht_h_usthht_2 Example 2

  The second example corresponds to a simple interpolation based on
  a tabulation defined hereafter and declared as a variable :

  \snippet usthht.f90 loc_var_dec

  The enthalpy-temperature conversion law is then defined :

  \snippet usthht.f90 example_2
