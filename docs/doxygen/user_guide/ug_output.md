Managing the output
===================

Introduction and main concepts {#cs_ug_postprocess_intro}
------------------------------

Logging and post-processing in code_saturne is handled so as to allow
combining the ease of automatic outputs for the main variables and more advanced
user-defined values or extracts.

Both the GUI and several functions present in \ref cs_user_postprocess.c allow
for managing post-processing output.

The main concepts are those of \em writers and \em meshes, which must be
associated to produce outputs.

- A \em writer combines the definition of an output type, frequency, path, and name.
  One or more \em writers can be defined using the GUI and the
  \ref cs_user_postprocess_writers user function.

- A \em mesh is based on a subset of the the computational mesh, or point
  sets such as particles or probe sets. One or more \em meshes can be defined
  using the GUI and the \ref cs_user_postprocess_meshes user function.

The combination of writers and meshes allows generating chronological outputs
in *EnSight*, *MED*, or *CGNS* format, as well as in-situ visualization
using [ParaView Catalyst](https://www.paraview.org/in-situ) or
ensemble data output to [Melissa](https://melissa-sa.github.io).

Using the GUI, writers can be managed and defined in the following page:

\anchor fig_gui_output_writers
![Management of postprocessing writers](gui_output_writers.png)

And postprocessing meshes can be handled in the following tab:

\anchor fig_gui_output_meshes
![Management of postprocessing meshes](gui_output_meshes.png)

In order to allow the user to add an output format to the main output format,
or to add a mesh to the default output, the lists of standard and user
meshes and writers are not separated. Negative numbers are reserved for
the non-user items. For instance, the mesh numbers -1
(\ref CS_POST_MESH_VOLUME) and -2 (\ref CS_POST_MESH_BOUNDARY) correspond
respectively to the global mesh and to boundary faces, generated by default,
and the writer -1 (\ref CS_POST_WRITER_DEFAULT) corresponds to the
default post-processing writer.

The user chooses the numbers corresponding to the post-processing
meshes and writers he wants to create. These numbers must be positive
integers. It is for example possible to associate a user mesh with the default
post-processing writer (-1), or to add outputs regarding the boundary
faces (-2) associated with a user writer.

For safety, the output frequency and the possibility to modify the
post-processing meshes are associated with the writers rather than
with the meshes. This logic avoids unwanted generation of
inconsistent post-processing outputs. For instance, ParaView or EnSight would not
be able to correctly read a case in which one field is output to a given part
every 10 time steps, while another field is output to the same part
every 200 time steps. If some fields should be output using different
frequencies, using separate writers allow maintaining consistent output sets.

\remark
The default meshes are initially associated with the default writer.
If new meshes are defined, they are not associated to any writer by default,
so the writers which will be used for the matching output must be associated.

To prevent output related to a given mesh (including the default),
the list of associated writers should be made empty.

Note that the default writer and meshes cannot be "undefined", though they
may be renamed and their settings modified. A writer with no associated mesh
is inactive, so removing the default writer from the list of writers associated
to all meshes deactivates the default output.

Probe sets and profiles
-----------------------

Probe sets allow defining a number of probes at user-defined locations.
The values of selected variables at these points may be output to specific
writers, usually *time plots* (CSV or regular text files with one column
per probe position and one line line output time step).
These are typically used:

- To monitor the computation's convergence at chosen points.
- To easily extract values at points for which measured data may be available.

Profiles are defined as a special type of probe set, for which a curvilinear
coordinate (the local profile coordinate) is defined, and are typically used not
with *time plots*, but with simple *plots* (also in CSV or text format)
where one file is associated to a single time step, and columns correspond
to different variables, and lines to different positions along the profile.

Probe sets and profiles are defined as a special category of postp-rocessing
meshes, so they can be also be used in combination with most other types
of writers.

The GUI currently only allows handling a single (default) probe set
for time plots. Probe coordinates can be entered directly or read
from a CSV file.

Profiles are also handled in a specific manner, as they are automatically
associated with default simple plot writers (CSV or text), and the
associated variables may be selected specifically.

\anchor fig_gui_output_profiles
![Management of 1D solution profiles](gui_output_profiles.png)

This presentation difference is mainly due to historic reasons (it predates
the unification of probes, profiles, and other writers), not to a difference
in the concepts used (so the logic may seem more consistent with user-defined
functions).

Time averages
-------------

In code_saturne, it is possible to define *time moments* for existing
variables (fields) or user-defined formulas, including both means
and variances. This is limited to visualization output, so for example
although the variance of a vector (which is a tensor due to the covariance
terms) may be computed, the variance of a tensor may not (though that
of specific components may always be computed).

This computation uses recurrence formulas, so at any given time steps,
the mean or variance field values are always updated and accessible as a regular
field. The computation of time moments may start at a user-defined time step of
physical time so as not to include transient initialization data. In this case, the
associated field values before actually starting the moment updates is 0.

Time moments may be defined in the GUI, as shown below, or using
the \ref cs_user_time_moments function in \ref cs_user_parameters.c
(see [Time moment related options examples](@ref cs_user_parameters_h_cs_user_moments)).

\anchor fig_gui_time_averages
![Management of time averaged variables](gui_time_averages.png)

Logging
-------

The logging output frequency may be managed using the GUI, as shown below.
The first 10 time steps are always logged.
When running many time steps, it recommended to use a logging period
greater than 1 (20 or 100 are often sufficient), as logging each time step
with even a moderate verbosity can lead to large *run_solver.log* files.

\anchor fig_gui_output_log
![Logging parameters](gui_output_log.png)

Note that logging verbosity is also influenced by the verbosity used for solved
variables.

Output variable selection
-------------------------

For the main computed values defined as *fields*, the GUI allows  defining
whether a given field with be associated using the default output meshes,
the default probe set, and the main log.

This can also be handled using the \ref post_vis and \ref log field key values.

Also, the "auto variables" flag may be assigned to additional post-processing meshes
so that output of fields behaves in a manner similar to that of the
default post-processing mesh in the same category (for example the main volume
mesh for a volume extract).

To output additional values, whether simply restricting output to a small subset of field
or adding values based on specific computations or formulas, see the
\ref cs_user_postprocess_values user function and associated examples
(in [Definition of the variables to post-process](@ref cs_user_postprocess_h_var_p)).

Analyzing the output
====================

Checking the convergence
------------------------

Checking the convergence is difficult to automate, but code_saturne
provides several tools to help manage this.

### Main log file

In the *run_solver.log* file for each run's output, a _convergence_ section similar
to the example below is available:

```
   ** INFORMATION ON CONVERGENCE

```

For each solved variable, it provides:
- The number of iterations required for the linear solvers (which depends on the
  chosen solver type, and may be converted to an "equivalent" cost estimation
  in some cases).
- The normalized residual.
- The *time drift*;\n
  For a given variable \f$ \varia \f$ this is usually the following term:

  \f[
    \int_\Omega \left| \der{\varia}{t} \right|^2 \Delta t \dd \Omega / \int_\Omega \dd \Omega
  \f]

  For the pressure variable it is computed in a different manner.

- The *time residual*;\n
  For a given variable \f$ \varia \f$ this is the normalized L<sup>2</sup> unsteady term:

  \f[
    \sqrt{\int_\Omega \left| \der{\varia}{t} \right|^2 \dd \Omega / \int_\Omega \left| \varia \right|^2 \dd \Omega}
  \f]

### Residuals file

A file named *residuals.csv* is usually produced, containing the residuals for solved
variables (as defined above), in an easy to plot CSV format.

### Time plots

It is recommended to place some *probes* at selected points of interest, so as to activate
time plots of the main variable values at those points.

This allows both checking how values evolve over time in selected points and if that
evolution is regular or "noisy".
