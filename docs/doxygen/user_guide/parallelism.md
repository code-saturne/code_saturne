[TOC]

Parallelism basics
==================

Parallelism is based on domain partitioning: each processor is assigned
a part of the domain, and data for cells on parallel boundaries
is duplicated on neighboring processors in corresponding "ghost",
or "halo" cells (both terms are used interchangeably). Values in
these cells may be accessed just the same as values in regular cells.
Communication is only required when cell values are modified
using values from neighboring cells, as the values in the "halo" can
not be computed correctly (since the halo does not have access to all
its neighbors), so halo values must be updated by copying values from
the corresponding cells on the neighboring processor.

Compared to other tools using a similar system, a specificity of
code_saturne is the separation of the halo in two parts: a standard part,
containing cells shared through faces on parallel boundaries, and an
extended part, containing cells shared through vertices, which is
used mainly for least squares gradient reconstruction using an
extended neighborhood. Most updates need only to operate on the standard
halo, requiring less data communication than those on the extended halos.

Periodicity
-----------

Periodicity is handled using the same halo structures as parallelism,
with an additional treatment for vector and coordinate values: updating
coordinates requires applying the periodic transformation to the copied
values, and in the case of rotation, updating vector and tensor values
also requires applying the rotation transformation.
Ghost cells may be parallel, periodic, or both. The example of a pump
combining parallelism and periodicity is given in the following figure
In this example, all periodic boundaries match with boundaries on
the same domain, so halos are either parallel or periodic.

Coding operations in parallel mode
----------------------------------

In parallel mode, the user must pay attention when performing
global operations. The following list is not exhaustive:

* calculation of extreme values on the domain (for instance, minimum
  and maximum of some calculation values);
* test of the existence of a certain value (for instance, do faces
  in a certain group exist?);
* verification of a condition on the domain (for instance, is a
  given flow value reached somewhere?);
* counting out of entities (for instance, how many cells have
  a nonzero source term value ?);
* global sum (for instance, calculation of a mass flow or the total
  mass of a pollutant).
* Access to values in neighboring cells: with periodicity or parallelism,
  some interior faces will be on parallel boundaries. When values
  in these cells may have been modified locally, it is necessary to
  "synchronize" the ghost values for that array, using functions such
  as \ref synsca in Fortran or \ref cs_halo_sync_var in C, before
  using the face neighbor values.
* In C code, the \ref cs_glob_rank_id and \ref cs_glob_n_ranks
  global variables can be used to query the current rank id
  (-1 in serial model, 0 to n-1 in parallel) and the number
  of ranks.
  - in Fortran, the matching variables are `irangp` and `nrangp`.
* The presence of periodicity is tested with the variable
  <tt>cs_glob_mesh->n_init_perio</tt> in C, `iperio` in Fortran
  (> 1 if periodicity is activated);
  - The presence of rotation periodicity is tested with the
    <tt>cs_glob_mesh->have_rotation_perio</tt> variable in C
    (`iperot` in Fortran).

The user may refer to the different
[parallel operation](@ref cs_user_extra_operations_examples_parallel_operations_p)
examples present.

Care should be taken with the fact that the boundaries between
subdomains consist of **internal** faces shared between
two processors (these are indeed internal faces, even if they are
located at a "processor boundary". They should not be counted twice
(once per processor) during global operations using internal faces
(for instance, counting the internal faces per processor and
summing all the obtained numbers drives into over-evaluating the
number of internal faces of the initial mesh).

### Logging operations in parallel mode

When running in parallel, only the first rank actually produces outputs
when writing to `run_solver.log` using the `nfecra` logical unit
in Fortran, or \ref bft_printf or \ref cs_log_printf in C.

This avoids requiring tests in calling code, which would add clutter
an could easily be forgotten.

### File ouptut operations in parallel mode

When writing simple output to files, it is important to check for the
local rank, and to avoid writing to a same file from multiple processors,
unless dedicated features are used, such as the \ref cs_file.c functions.

### Some notes about periodicity

Note that periodic faces are not part of the domain boundary:
periodicity is interpreted as a "geometric" condition
rather than a classical boundary condition.

Some particular points should be noted:

* Periodicity should work when the periodic boundaries are meshed
  differently (periodicity of non-conforming faces), *except* for
  the case of a 180 degree rotation periodicity.
* Rotation periodicity is incompatible with
  * semi-transparent radiation,
  * reinforced velocity-pressure coupling `ipucou=1`
