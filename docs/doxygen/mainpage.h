  \mainpage Code_Saturne documentation

  \section mainpage_intro Introduction

  Code_Saturne is EDF's general purpose Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
  software.

  The basic capabilities of Code_Saturne enable the handling of either
  incompressible or expandable flows with or without heat transfer and
  turbulence. Dedicated modules are available for specific physics such as
  radiative heat transfer, combustion (gas, coal, heavy fuel oil, ...),
  magneto-hydrodynamics, compressible flows, two-phase flows
  (Euler-Lagrange approach with two-way coupling), or atmospheric flows.

  \section mainpage_install Installation

  Code_Saturne may be configured and installed using the
  \c configure shell script and \c make. Please read the \c INSTALL
  file in the toplevel source directory if you are not familiar
  with configuration scripts generated through GNU autoconf and automake.

  \section mainpage_sublibs Sub-libraries

  See \ref mainpage_ple "PLE" (Parallel Location and Exchange).

  \section mainpage_user_sources User sources, functions, and subroutines

  Many user examples are available in the \ref cs_user_examples "user examples tab":
    - \ref cs_user_boundary_conditions_examples "User boundary conditions definitions",
    - \ref cs_user_extra_operations_examples "User extra operations",
    - \ref cs_user_initialization "Physical fields user initialization",
    - and so on ...

  \section additional_doc Additional documentation
